    "In the current exercise, I made three derived features in the original diabetes dataset: BMI × BP (to try and capture the combined impact of obesity and blood pressure), age² (to create a model that reflects the nonlinear increase in risk with age), and age × BMI (to try to capture how the impact of obesity might change across ages). In comparing the models, upon reaching the baseline regression, I had the regression achieve an R² of 0.45 and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of about 2900 for the test data and the developed features achieve an R² of 0.49 and MSE of about 2728. If we sum the results of the regression over 5-fold cross validation, the mean R² (baseline) of 0.48 is now mean R² (with derived features) of 0.49. The values demonstrate that including interactions and nonlinear transformations is a consistent strategy for improving predictive accuracy, and moreover, assure that derived features capture patterns in the data as feature interactions that a baseline feature alone could not portray."
